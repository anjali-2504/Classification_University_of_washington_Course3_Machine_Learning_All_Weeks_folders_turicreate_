I used turicreate library to build a binary decision tree model which could classify if a particular loan is risk or safe.
I also implemented boosting algorithm and gradient ascent algorithms to imporve the efficency of the model. 
Built a logistice regression model using gradient ascent algortihm.
Compared the accuracy ,precision , recall for various decision tree models.
